            There is a research paper that says synesthesia is experienced by a larger percentage of professional
            musicians than in the general population. Specifically, sound-colour synesthesia, grapheme-colour 
            synesthesia, and sequence-space synesthesia are more common among musicians.
        </p>
        <p>
            I don't know whether the musician with synesthesia are better musicians than the ones without, but I
            would assume they have some advantage. Being able to locate a note in colour space as well as sound 
            space could help with memorization for example.

            Synethesia being a beneficial trait is interesting to me. It is like eidetic memory which has obvious
            advantages, but intuitively it doesn't make sense how someone can have unliminited memory storage and 
            still function. You would think storing so many memories would come with severe tradeoffs, but I don't
            think I've read any self-reports that described any downsides in such a way that would come close to 
            making me lose my desire for the ability. With synesthesia, you would think that linking one dimension 
            with another, in arbitrary ways, could be distracting, rather than productive, but again, I have never
            heard of any negative effects of it that would outweigh simply its novelty, let alone the enhancements
            suggested by the new research. In fact, if you read the summary tweet, it explicitly says synesthesia
            "causes no impairment".

            I've recently been thinking about my tendency to over-practice new things I learn so that they become
            "muscle memory". In a way it is like in high level programming languages, some functions are pushed 
            down to a lower level so that they execute faster. I tend to want to convert too much of my skills into 
            "muscle memory". This is good if the brain can be accurately modelled as a limited resource that needs 
            to be optimized for speed. But I often encounter situations that make me realize that I've been overdoing
            this. Especially with skills that are more conceptual, it is better to keep them at a higher level where 
            you can reflect about them more and periodically allow new associations with other concepts to develop.
        <p>
            I think this silly tendency of mine could be a result of a fear of "running out of space" in my brain. 
            Where does this fear come from though? Maybe I've had lots of first hand encounters with other people 
            who remember things better than me, so I know that I'm on the lower end of the spectrum when it comes 
            to memory ability, which leads me to over-compensate. Or it could be due to low exposure to variety of
            knowledge and skills when I was younger, leading me to believe that there is not a massive amount of 
            things to learn anyway so I should focus on optimizing what I have.

            Is it possible to acquire synesthesia or eidetic memory by trying to unlearn the scarcity mindset?
            Scarcity vs abundance - they've always felt like just words to me and I do not have grapheme to anything 
            synesthesia. I don't know how to internalize "abundance" so that I actually change my thinking patterns. 
            Should I just say "but" less? This post is for the purpose of anchoring this thought, so that subconsciously
            I can start working on, like that lucid dreaming trick you may have heard of.
